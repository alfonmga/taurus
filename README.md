The definitive modern stack to build your web projects ðŸ› 

* `Client` powered by Next.js + Apollo GraphQL Client + Formik..etc
* `API` powered by NestJS + TypeORM (PostgreSQL) + Apollo GraphQL Server + Passport.js..etc
* Shared code between client-side and server-side ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)!)
* Strongly-typed (thanks to TypeScript, @nestjs/typeorm, @nestjs/graphql and GraphQL Code Generator)
* Tooling ready (TSConfig, ESLint and Prettier)
* Storybook
* Easy deployment

*`Taurus` is just a personal proof-of-concept that you can use or get inspired by. I have been building web applications using a similar architecture/technologies for a few years but I never was satisfied with the chosen stack. After blood, sweat, and tears I believe found with `Taurus` the perfect stack to build on my future side projects.*
